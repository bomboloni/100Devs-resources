## Welcome to my #100Devs Resources Project!

### [The Website](https://100devsresources.netlify.app/)

I'm working on putting together a collection of resources that I've found helpful and think other people involved with 100Devs might find useful too.

At the moment the site is very heavy on class links and resources, but I'm working hard at adding more of my links so that soon it will also be useful to people looking for something to help them with a particular topic, such as understanding javascript array methods, for example.

A lot more is coming! ðŸš€

**If you just want to use the repo and not the website**, you can find the markdown files with all the links in them in the vault directory.

### Tools I'm using to make this:

I recently started using [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so) to consolidate my notes into a more usable form. One of it's features is website creation, so I thought it would be a good idea to push some of what I've learned out into the world. Dendron uses markdown language and the reulting site should be simple, fluid, and utilitarian.

While I'm enjoying learning Dendron and using it to better organize me notes (and cut down on my 100s of browser tabs!) the documentation is a bit spotty and it's somewhat of a time sink to get started. 100Devs peep are already swamped learning a million new tools and concepts. I don't recommend going down another rabbit hole unless you really, really have a burning desire to do so. ðŸ”¥
