## Welcome to my #100Devs Resources Project!

I'm working on putting together a collection of resources that I've found helpful and think other people involved with 100Devs might find useful too.

### Tools I'm using to make this:

I recently started using [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so) to consolidate my notes into a more usable form. One of it's features is website creation, so I thought it would be a good idea to push some of what I've learned out into the world. Dendron uses markdown language and the reulting site should be simple, fluid, and utilitarian.

The site's not up yet (soon!) and this project is still in its infancy, but if you want to poke around and make use of the external links I've put together already, go into the vault folder and click on any of the .md files. Root.md is essentially the index, and it has a lot of the main #100Devs links in one place, including links to all the VODs.

A lot more will be coming! ðŸš€
