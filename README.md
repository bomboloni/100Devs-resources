## Welcome to my #100Devs Resources Project!

### [The Website](https://100devsresources.netlify.app/)

I'm working on putting together a collection of resources that I've found helpful and think other people involved with 100Devs might find useful too.

At the moment the site is very heavy on class links and resources, but I'm working hard at adding more of my links so that soon it will also be useful to people looking for something to help them with a particular topic, such as understanding javascript array methods, for example.

A lot more is coming! ðŸš€

**If you just want to use the repo and not the website**, you can find the markdown files with all the links in them in the vault directory.

### Tools I'm using to make this:

I recently started using [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so) to consolidate my notes into a more usable form. One of it's features is website creation, so I thought it would be a good idea to push some of what I've learned out into the world. Dendron uses markdown language and the reulting site should be simple, fluid, and utilitarian.

Dendron is a VSCode extension that uses markdown langauge, and it will automagically (ha! there was a lot of futzing) build a static website site based on [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev).

This repo is connected to Netlify, and whenever I push a commit Netlify automagically (for real this time) updates the site.
