### [Slides](https://slides.com/leonnoel)

You can find all of Leon's slide presentations here. Pro Tip: they are useful for making Anki decks.

### [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net)

A free flashcard app. Don't pay for the iOS version - you can make an account and use it from Safari. Pro Tip: VSCode has an Anki extension that makes making some types of cards easier.
