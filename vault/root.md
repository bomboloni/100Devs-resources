# #100Devs Resources

Hi, I'm **bomboloni** (aka Sandy). This is a personal and idiosyncratic collection of links and resources that I've collected and found helpful as I [learn along with Leon](https://leonnoel.com/100devs/), and I thought that others might find it useful too, so here you are!

This site is obviously still in it's early stages, and I imagine it continuing to evolve even as it becomes more 'finished'.

**And on that note:** some of the internal links in the insets aren't working. For now you can get around that by clicking "go to text" in the upper right of each inset box.
