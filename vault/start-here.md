If you're new to #100Devs these are the main links you'll need to get started. Class is live on Twitch Tuesdays and Thursdays at 3:30pm Pacific Time and usually runs about 3 hours.

Discord is where everything gets posted and where you can go and ask questions and hang out. Drop in, say hi, and poke around.

Good luck and have fun! You've got this!
