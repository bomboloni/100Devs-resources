### [Slides](https://slides.com/leonnoel)

You can find all of Leon's slide presentations here. Pro Tip: they are useful for making Anki decks.

### [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net)

A free flashcard app. Don't pay for the iOS version - you can make an account and use it from Safari. Pro Tip: VSCode has an Anki extension that makes making some types of cards easier.

## Additional Homework Links

I'm not intentionally including dates here. The dates were often in flux when class was in real time, and at this point new people are working on their own and at their own pace. Do what works for you, and ask questions in Discord!

Also - I joined class late and am adding these links long after the fact. I _think_ the homework listed was assigned after its class and not due before. I may be wrong in some cases, so pay attention and figure things out as you go along. You can always refer to Leon's posts on Discord.

> reduce
> filter
> forEach

> push
> unshift
> includes
> indexOf
> every

> Give a short description of what the method does, how it works, it's time complexity (if appropriate), and give three examples of it in action!

Questions to practice:

> One:
> Given a non-empty array of integers, return the result of multiplying the values together in order. Example:
> [1, 2, 3, 4] => 1 _ 2 _ 3 \* 4 = 24

> Two:
> You will be given an array of all the family members' ages, in any order. The ages will be given in whole numbers, so a baby of 5 months, will have an ascribed 'age' of 0. Return a new array with [youngest age, oldest age, difference between the youngest and oldest age].

> Three:
> Sum all the numbers of the array except the highest and the lowest element (the value, not the index!).
> Example:
> [ 6, 2, 1, 8, 10 ] => 16
> [ 1, 1, 11, 2, 3 ] => 6
